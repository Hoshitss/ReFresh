# ReFresh
Hackathon

An online platform meant to enhance lively discussions of food and recipes, engagingly shared with a community of food enthusiasts, cooks, and farmers, and an idea exchange where varied and new recipes are found while sharing experiences with cooking. A platform that brings together foodies with the producers of agriculture gives more appreciation towards origins, hence creating avenues where different individuals celebrate their culinary creativity in a conducive and interactive manner.
